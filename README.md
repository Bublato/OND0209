WalkieTalkieProject
This is a school project.
Application that uses WifiP2PManager to connect devices via WiFi Direct
Application also allows users to talk to each other without internet. 
It is not even close to perfect, it has few bugs that need to be taken care of. 
Agenda: DISCOVER btn discovers devices that support WifiDirect and are visible.
        After discovery, select the device that you wish to connect to and press CONNECT btn.
        After pressing CONNECT btn, the device will contact selected device and it will wait for selected device to confirm connection.
        After that, hold few seconds for the devices to establish connection.
        Then press and hold STREAM btn to talk to other device.
